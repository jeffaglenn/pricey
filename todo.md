## Recently Completed ✅

### Browser Fingerprint Randomization (January 2025)
- **Context-level randomization**: User agent, viewport, locale, timezone, geolocation
- **JavaScript-level randomization**: Screen properties, hardware specs, WebGL, canvas, audio
- **Debug mode**: `--debug` flag shows detailed randomization information
- **Files added**: `fingerprint-randomizer.js` with comprehensive randomization logic
- **Integration**: Fully integrated into `scraper.js` with optional logging

### Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic (January 2025)
- **Multi-browser retry**: Automatic progression Safari → Firefox → Chrome on failures
- **Intelligent error classification**: Network, bot detection, parsing, server errors
- **Exponential backoff**: Smart retry delays based on error type (3+ seconds)
- **Browser switching**: Different browser engines to evade detection
- **Files added**: `retry-handler.js`, `browser-manager.js` with comprehensive retry strategies
- **Integration**: Seamless browser switching with proper error propagation

### PostgreSQL Migration & Retailer System (January 2025)

- **Files added**: `database-pg.js`, `retailer-manager.js`, `schema.sql`
- **Integration**: Complete PostgreSQL integration with backward-compatible CLI interface

## Future Features - Not Currently Needed

### Proxy Support
**Current Status**: Not implemented - current usage pattern (1-2 requests/hour) doesn't require proxy infrastructure.

**When to implement:**
- High-volume scraping (>10 requests/hour per site)
- IP blocking occurs despite fingerprint randomization
- Concurrent multi-product monitoring
- Geographic price comparison needs

**Proxy Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Add proxy rotation functionality to scraper.js
- [ ] Implement residential proxy integration (consider services like Bright Data, Oxylabs)
- [ ] Add proxy health checking and automatic failover
- [ ] Create proxy configuration management system
- [ ] Create proxy configuration interface

### Advanced Session Management
**Current Status**: Not implemented - current fingerprint randomization and multi-browser approach is sufficient for low-volume usage.

**When to implement:**
- High-frequency scraping where human behavior simulation becomes critical
- Sites start detecting and blocking based on browsing patterns
- Need to maintain complex user states across sessions

**Session Management Tasks**:
- [ ] Create user session simulation (browsing patterns, timing)
- [ ] Add session storage for maintaining login states
- [ ] Implement realistic mouse movement and scrolling patterns
- [ ] Add human-like page interaction simulation

### Cookie Persistence
**Current Status**: Not implemented - low-volume usage doesn't require session continuity.

**When to implement:**
- Sites start requiring cookie-based session continuity
- Bot detection specifically targets fresh browser sessions
- Need to maintain shopping cart or user preference state

**Cookie Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement cookie persistence between scraping sessions
- [ ] Add domain-specific cookie storage
- [ ] Create cookie expiration and cleanup management
- [ ] Add cookie debugging and validation tools

## Implementation Notes

- Start with the most problematic retailers first
- Test each improvement against current success rates
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing database
- Consider splitting scraper.js into multiple retailer-specific modules
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging new implementations
- **Fingerprint randomization significantly improved success rates** - continue building on this foundation
- **Proxy support deferred** - focus on retailer-specific solutions first
