**🔄 IN PROGRESS:**
- Advanced browser behavior simulation
- Configuration versioning and hot-reloading
- Comprehensive testing framework

**⏳ NOT STARTED:**
- Proxy rotation support
- Advanced session management
- Cookie persistence
- Screenshot capture for failed scrapes

## Future Features - Not Currently Needed

### Proxy Support
**Current Status**: Not implemented - current usage pattern (1-2 requests/hour) doesn't require proxy infrastructure.

**When to implement:**
- High-volume scraping (>10 requests/hour per site)
- IP blocking occurs despite fingerprint randomization
- Concurrent multi-product monitoring
- Geographic price comparison needs

**Proxy Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Add proxy rotation functionality to scraper.js
- [ ] Implement residential proxy integration (consider services like Bright Data, Oxylabs)
- [ ] Add proxy health checking and automatic failover
- [ ] Create proxy configuration management system
- [ ] Create proxy configuration interface

### Advanced Session Management
**Current Status**: Not implemented - current fingerprint randomization and multi-browser approach is sufficient for low-volume usage.

**When to implement:**
- High-frequency scraping where human behavior simulation becomes critical
- Sites start detecting and blocking based on browsing patterns
- Need to maintain complex user states across sessions

**Session Management Tasks**:
- [ ] Create user session simulation (browsing patterns, timing)
- [ ] Add session storage for maintaining login states
- [ ] Implement realistic mouse movement and scrolling patterns
- [ ] Add human-like page interaction simulation

### Cookie Persistence
**Current Status**: Not implemented - low-volume usage doesn't require session continuity.

**When to implement:**
- Sites start requiring cookie-based session continuity
- Bot detection specifically targets fresh browser sessions
- Need to maintain shopping cart or user preference state

**Cookie Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement cookie persistence between scraping sessions
- [ ] Add domain-specific cookie storage
- [ ] Create cookie expiration and cleanup management
- [ ] Add cookie debugging and validation tools

## Implementation Notes

- **Current success rate**: 78.95% overall, with major retailers (Amazon, Target, Walmart) at 100%
- **Best Buy needs attention**: Currently 0% success rate, may need selector updates
- **Generic selectors working well**: 80% success rate for unknown retailers
- **Multi-browser approach effective**: Browser switching successfully handles bot detection
- **Fingerprint randomization significantly improved success rates** - continue building on this foundation
- **Proxy support deferred** - focus on retailer-specific solutions first
- **Database-driven architecture working well** - ready for UI expansion
